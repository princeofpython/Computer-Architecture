# Assignment 4 - Pipelined CPU
Implement a pipelined version of the single-cycle CPU designed in assignment 3. 

Required in submission:

- Clear block diagram of the components
- Comments and explanation in the Verilog code indicating which part of code corresponds to which part of the diagram
- Analysis of the performance: based on synthesis reports, what is the best clock speed at which the system can run  

The minimum expectation is functional correctness - all instructions must execute properly. In addition to that, forwarding and hazard detection are also required, but if not fully implemented, there should be explanations of how to get around the problems.
